    "In this particular notebook, we added eight different technical indicators into the state representation, enabling the agent to choose the best action based on the current state. Additionally, we used 14 as the window size and then split the dataset into two groups: training and testing. We trained the agent for 250,000 timesteps, equivalent to 117 episodes. At the end, we evaluated the agent's performance based on the average total reward and average total profit gained after a 10-episode evaluation on unseen data (testing data)."
